# A Simple ERC20 Token

This project includes a basic ERC20 Token developed with Solidity and Hardhat.
The token extends the ERC20 Standard from Open Zeppelin.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy-token.js
npx hardhat help
```
